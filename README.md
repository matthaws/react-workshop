# React: Beyond the Basics

App Academy Job Seeker Technical Workshop 4/26/18

### Learning Goals

Graduates of the aA curriculum have a solid foundational understanding of using the React framework. However, there is not time in the course to cover many of its features or common design patterns used in React development. In this workshop, we will be exploring and demoing the following React features:

* type checking with propTypes
* defaultProps
* interacting with the native DOM via refs
* controlled vs uncontrolled components
* Fragments
* the new Context API

We will also look at some common React design patterns including:

* Compound Components
* Higher Order Components

Along the way we'll brush up against some ES7+ JavaScript syntax with which you may be unfamiliar:

* Async / Await syntax for Promises
* Object Rest/Spread Properties

### Demos

* [PropTypes && default props]('/src/components/propTypes')
