# React: Beyond the Basics

App Academy Job Seeker Technical Workshop 4/26/18

### Learning Goals

Graduates of the aA curriculum have a solid foundational understanding of the React framework. However, there is not time in the course to cover many of its features or some common design patterns used in React development. In this workshop, we will be exploring and demoing the following React features:

* type checking with propTypes & using default props
* interacting with the native DOM via refs
* controlled vs uncontrolled components
* Fragments

We will also look at some common React design patterns including:

* Higher Order Components

Along the way we'll brush up against some ES7+ JavaScript syntax and web APIs with which you may be unfamiliar:

* Async / Await syntax for Promises
* Object Rest/Spread Properties
* Fetch for making AJAX requests (rather than JQuery's `$.ajax()`)

### Next Lecture

On May 10, we'll have React: Beyond the Basics THE SEQUEL, where we'll cover:

* render props
* compound components
* the context API
* the suspense API (maybe)

### Demos

* [PropTypes && default props](src/components/propTypes)
* [Refs](src/components/refs)
* [Fragments](src/components/fragments)
* [Higher Order Components](src/components/higherOrderComponents)
